          <h2>How to Become a Private Tutor?</h2>
          <p>
            If you're asking yourself, "How do I become a tutor?" or "How do I
            find tutoring jobs near me?" you've come to the right place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting your tutoring job is very simple. In fact, by landing on
            this page you're already halfway there. In just 10 minutes, you can
            create your online tutoring advert on Superprof, and you can start
            advertising lessons locally and via webcam. The only thing we ask is
            a little goodwill when creating your profile, for you to give a
            short description of your past experience, and for you to add a
            clear, high-quality photo of yourself.

        <div class="lesson-col">
          <h2>Why Become a Tutor?</h2>
          <p>
            Everyone has a passion to share or a skill to teach. Tutoring is
            great for people looking for a flexible schedule, part-time teaching
            jobs, online teaching jobs, careers after teaching, or to start
            their own business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Superprof is completely free to use for tutors, and offers everyone
            the chance to teach. We offer online tutoring jobs for students,
            online tutoring jobs for teachers, Matric level Maths tutor jobs,
            dance teacher jobs, French tutoring jobs, art tutor jobs and
            thousands more.

          <h2>I'm a Student, Can I Become a Tutor?</h2>
          <p>
            Students are highly sought-after as tutors. Having recently finished
            or currently studying your chosen discipline, you have an ideal
            profile to give peer tutoring or mentoring from home, and homework
            support for school students.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, students at university or business school often have
            versatile skill sets that enable them to offer courses to those who
            need help across a variety of subjects. Whether you're a physics
            tutor, Spanish tutor, ESL teacher or biology tutor, everyone is
            welcome on Superprof
          </p>
          <p>
            Tutoring jobs are great for students looking for part-time or
            holiday work, that fits in with their busy timetables and active
            social lives.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson-col">
          <h2>
            I am a School Teacher, Am I Authorised to Tutor Privately as Well?
          </h2>
          <p>
            In SA there are no laws against offering private tuition while
            employed as a teacher, and many teachers supplement their incomes by
            offering in-home tutoring and online tutoring.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, why not teach in a more relaxed environment as a private tutor
            or online tutor? No large classrooms to control, no detentions to
            issue. Get paid a great hourly wage with one-on-one lessons and be
            your own boss!
          </p>
          <p>
            It is; however, essential to check the policy of the school at which
            you are employed, as some establishments place restrictions on
            teacher's ability to tutor children from their own classes or
            school. You may want to limit your tutoring to students outside your
            classroom or school, even if not directed to do so, to avoid any
            conflicts of interest, such as perceived favouritism, that could
            arise.
